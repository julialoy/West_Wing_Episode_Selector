Josh Lyman, the Deputy Chief of Staff, is in trouble after a television appearance in which he makes an insulting comment to a representative of a political-connected Christian group; and Sam Seaborn, the Deputy Director of Communications, spends the night with a woman who turns out to be a prostitute. Another subplot is 1,200 Cuban boat refugees, 137 of whom arrive in Miami an request asylum, while 350 are missing in a storm and presumed dead.",
        "expandedPlot": "The White House staff is being called into work early to deal with the press fallout after President Josiah Bartlet has crashed his bicycle into a tree. As the staff try to perform damage control, it is revealed that Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman made a gaffe when, after provication by Christian activist Mary Marsh on a recent televised debate, quipped 'Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted for tax fraud.' Also, Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn spends an evening with Laurie (Lisa Edelstein), unaware that she's a call girl, and then tells Chief of Staff Leo McGarry's daughter, Mallory O'Brien, about it before he knows whose daughter she is.\n While Lyman and Marsh are discussing a proposed public debate on one of several religious wedge issues, President Bartlet enters and corrects one of the attendees on a theological point (namely, he quotes the First Commandment, settling a dispute on which one it is). He explains that he crashed his bicycle while distracted by anger after discovering that his granddaughter, after expressing herself as pro-choice during a magazine interview, was mailed a Raggedy Ann doll with a knife stuck in its throat. The doll was sent by an extremist group whose activities the attendees, to his displeasure, have not denounced. He tells them that not only will there be no debate, but that they will denounce the extremists publicly, and are barred from the White House until they do so. Bartlet implies to Lyman that he will be allowed to keep his job despite the gaffe.",

        "expandedSummary": "President Bartlet seeks vengeance after Syrian operatives shot down a transport aircraft carrying his personal physician and 57 other US military health care workers. The Joint Chiefs of Staff propose a proportional response to the attack, which involves air strikes against three low-level targets in Syria as well as one against the Syrian intelligence agency headquarters. However, President Bartlet wants a stronger response, so the Joint Chiefs draft a plan to attack a much more prominent target: the international airport in Damascus. The subtext of the story involves the President's unease around the Joint Chiefs and his worries about their respecting him having never served in the armed forces. Leo talks with Admiral Percy Fitzwallace, USN, the Chairman of the Joing Chiefs, who says the President is doing fine. Fitzwallace later tells the President that his desired response is disproportionate, saying he will have 'doled out five thousand dollars worth of punishment for a fifty buck crime.' Leo confronts President Bartlet about the disproportionate response and says that he will stand up against him if he continues to insist on it. The President confesses that he has personalized the attack because his physician, a good man with a newborn daughter, was among the victims. He then authorizes the proportional response and gives a televised speech, in which he explains the situation to the American people. Meanwhile, C.J. talks reporter Danny Concannon out of writing a story about Sam's relationship with the prostitute, and Charlie Young applies for a messenger job at the White House but impresses Josh so much that he insists on hiring Charlie as the President's personal aide and body man.",

        "briefSummary": "While staff members strive to regain five crucial votes on a gun bill, Leo (John Spencer) is told by his wife (Sara Botsford) that their marriage is in trouble.",
        "expandedSummary": "The White House has surprisingly lost five votes for an incremental gun control bill, so the West Wing staff work during the three remaining days to regain the votes for the passage of the bill. After Leo forgets his wedding anniversary, his wife announces that she is leaving him. Josh and Toby encounter difficulties over their personal financial disclosures which are being shared publicly. The last gun bill vote is secured thanks to the Vice President who counted on being the hero in of the process.",
        "expandedPlot": "While President Josiah Bartlet delivers a speech priding the inevitable passage of a gun control bill in the House, his staff learns that said passage is in jeopardy. Chief of Staff Leo McGarry calls an emergency meeting in which he instructs C.J. Cregg to play up the release of the staff's financial disclosure report to provide cover for them to work on getting the votes. Sam suggests using the Vice President, but Leo shoots down this idea. When Leo finally arrives home, he finds his wife still awake, having expected Leo home hours before. He also realizes he has completely forgotten it was their wedding anniversary.\n The disclosure report brings with it a number of comical revelations (including a valuable smoking jacket given to Josh from an ex-girlfriend). It also brings with it some trouble---the report reveals that a stock Toby invested in went from $5,000 to over $125,000, soon after he had arranged for a friend to testify before Congress about stocks. Toby insists he had no idea what his friend was going to testify about, and it was an innocent coincidence. Nevertheless, with the report being made public, there is concern he may be indicted on federal charges of manipulating the stock market. Sam suggests that they announce Toby will avoid any potential legal and political landmines at the expense of cashing out his stocks the next day and dropping his salary to a dollar for the next year, to which a drugged-out President Bartlet agrees. This led a stunned Toby to tell the rest of the senior staff that he feels 'like I just got screwed with my pants on.'\n Josh manages to strong-arm one of the five defecting Congressmen into getting back in line by threatening that the President will not endorse him in the Midterms. This action prompts two other defectors to switch their votes back. Josh then meets with Congressman Christopher Wick, an old college fraternity buddy, whom he angrily confronts about going against the President. Wick replies that he broke ranks to prove he's not on a leash, but he'll change his vote again for a photo op with the President. Josh, disgusted by the Congressman's motives, nonetheless complies with his wishes.\n Leo reluctantly must now turn to the Vice President. He scheDulés the meeting for late, wanting to spend most of the evening with his wife to make up for his lapse the night before; he had spent the day planning an in-house dinner for the two, at one point buying her a pearl choker by Harry Winston. When he arrives home, however, he finds Jenny, with her bags packed. She announces she's leaving him, that she can no longer bear the life they have. Leo, distraught over the thought of her leaving him, still insists his job is more important than their marriage.\n Shaken, Leo meets with Hoynes, who immediately realizes something is wrong. Leo confides in Hoynes, and the VP tells Leo about a secret AA meeting he hosts with several other prominent politicians and administrators, inviting him to come. He also says he will be happy to speak with Tillinghouse.\n The following day, Hoynes makes good on his promise, convincing Tillinghouse to go along with the bill as a personal favor to him, stating directly that the Congressman would be wise to do what he asks because 'one day I'll be President...and you won't be.' He also encourages Tillinghouse to speak with the four other Congressmen who were compelled to vote yes (all of whom are looking for a little political retribution). After the bill is signed, all five of the Congressmen pile the credit upon the Vice President, making the victory more hollow for President Bartlet. Most of the staff are upset with this result and realize that asking Hoynes would lead to a PR sacrifice, however Leo ends by saying that it was hubris on the part of the President and his staff. Josh later congratulates Hoynes on a game well played.\n The episode ends with Leo attending the AA meeting.",

Zoey Bartlet, the youngest First Daughter, arrives at the White House, and the President holds a celebratory chili supper in her honor for the members of his inner circle.",
        "expandedPlot": "The staff participates in 'Big Block of Cheese Day,' a fictional workday on which White House Chief of Staff Leo McGarry encourages his staff to meet with fringe special interest groups that normally would not get attention from the White House. Big Block of Cheese Day is also mentioned in 'Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail.'\n The rationale for the day, as recounted by McGarry (much to the consternation of the senior staff), is that America's seventh president, Andrew Jackson, had a two-ton block of cheese in the White House foyer from which everyone was welcome to eat. This symbolized the openness of the White House to the American people. White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler derisively refers to teh day as 'Throw Open Our Doors To People Who Want To Discuss Things That We Could [sic] Care Less About Day,' and Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman refers to it as 'Total Crackpot Day.'\n White House Press Secretary C.J. Cregg meets with a group about building a highway for wolves, while Sam Seaborn meets with a citizen, played by Sam Lloyd, concerned about UFOs.\n JOsh is given a card from the National Security Council with information about where he is to go in the event of a nuclear attack and becomes riddled with guilt after realizing that nobody else on the staff was given one. He visits his therapist and reveals that his older sister died in a house fire while babysitting for him, and that he survived by running out of the house.\n Later, President Bartlet hosts a reception in the Residence for his youngest daughter, Zoey, who is scouting colleges in the D.C. area. (Earlier in the day, upon learning of her visit, the President announces to everyone that he will make chili for them all.) In a private conversation, the President, Leo and Josh marvel at the extraordinary strength and integrity of the women in their lives. During the party, Josh returns his NSC card to the President, explaining that he just wants to be with his friends through everything and to be able to look them in the eye in the meantime.",

Zoey has an unfortunate encounter in which she needs the help of the U.S. Secret Service while at a Georgetown college bar in the company of friends from the White House. This displeases her father, who lectures her about 'the nightmare scenario'---the possibility of her abduction being used against the government.

Toby requests a favor from a senior aide to the Indonesian president; the aide not only refuses but also lectures Toby about human rights, and for being a hypocrite. At the state dinner, the First Lady, Abigail Bartlet, makes her first appearance, and Sam sees Laurie, who is working as an escort for one of the attendees. In a predictable move to evade the storm, an aircraft carrier task group of the US Navy, including two cruisers and two destroyers, gets underway from Norfolk, Virginia, and heads into the Atlantic Ocean; however, the hurricane makes a surprise course change and moves directly toward and across the naval vessels. With difficulty, the President chats via radio with a young petty officer in the radio shack aboard a small ship in the task group.",

        "briefSummary": "In a poignant Christmas episode, a business card in the pocket of an overcoat donated to Goodwill ties Toby to a homeless Korean War vet. The card is the only link between Toby and Walter Huffnagle, but when Huffnagle's body is found on the Mall two days before Christmas, Toby has found his holiday mission: arrange a military funeral for him. Meanwhile, Danny (Timothy Busfield) wants to date C.J., but she's leery. She's also preoccupied with hate crimes legislation.",
        "expandedSummary": "While senior staffers discuss the preparations for the Christmas celebration at the West Wing, Toby receives a telephone call from the office of the local coroner, and he responds by meeting a detective of the Metro PD at the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the National Mall to identify a body who had been found wearing a jacket that had Toby's business card in the pocket. Toby becomes emotionally and actively involved with the death of the man, who he discovers was a homeless veteran and had served as a lance corporal in the US Marine Corps in the Korean War, and works to find out the man's identity and next of kin. C.J. tries to push for hate crime legislation after a deadly assault on a young gay man but receives little support amongst senior staff. Danny and C.J. continue to discuss the pros and cons of a first date. Sam and Josh, against Leo's wishes, visit Laurie to try and get dirt on Lillienfield and his allies, but she refuses to tell them anything and reminds them to behave as the good guys. Toby and Mrs. Landingham accompany the veteran's brother to his burial at Arlington National Cemetery with an honor guard.",
        "expandedPlot": "As the episode begins, Toby gets called by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia to identify a dead homeless man. It turns out the man (a Korean War veteran from the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines who received the Purple Heart) was wearing a coat that Toby donated to Goodwill, and Toby had left his business card in it. The event stays with him, and he tracks down the man's next of kin. The only relative he can find is a brother, also homeless. Using the influence of the President's office, he arranges a military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery. President Bartlet is informed about Toby's transgression, but can only muster limited indignation and jocularly asks if the country is still in NATO. To the President's concern that this could create precedent for other veterans to come forward, Toby replies 'I can only hope, sir.' Mrs. Landingham, who has just told Charlie Young about losing her twin sons in the Vietnam War, joins Toby and the veteran's brother at the funeral.\n Meanwhile, Josh Lyman---who is worried that Rep. Peter Lillienfield (R) may disclose information the Congressman has about Leo McGarry's past treatment for alcohol and Valium abuse---approaches Sam Seaborn and proposes using Sam's prostitute friend to dig up dirt as leverage against Lillienfield's allies when the time comes. Leo objects strongly to the plan, calling it unethical.\n C.J. Cregg gets emotionally involved in a story about the deadly assault on a gay youth. She sees this as an opportunity to push hate crime legislation, but the suggestion finds little support among the others. Reporter Danny Concannon disagrees, but this encourages her to finally accept his offer of a date, to have him convince her.\n Bartlet sneaks out to go shopping at a rare book store and refuses to take photographers along, much to Mandy Hampton's chagrin. Donna Moss has at this point been pestering Josh about her Christmas gift all day. While he doesn't follow the list submitted, he picks up a book for her at the shop and writes a message in it that leaves her tearful but happy.",

        "expandedSummary": "US satellite surveillance detects that India has moved six warships and 300,000 ground troops against Pakistan and its occupation of Kashmir, thereby raising the possibility of a nuclear clash; the United Nations tries to get a cease-fire agreement. After receiving a dismal intelligence briefing on the situation with India, President Bartlet send for Lord John Marbury, an eccentric former ambassador of the United Kingdom to India, whom the President describes as colorful and Leo describes as a lunatic. The ambassador from Beijing tells the President that China may enter the fight against India, the ambassador from Islamabad tells him that Pakistan will no longer tolerate any oppression of its people, and the ambassador from New Delhi tells him that India will no longer follow the directions of any other nation. However, Lord Marbury reports that the UK ambassador to the UN expects to obtain a two-week cease-fire agreement, and he agrees to stay to help. C.J. expresses displeasure about her loss of credibility with the press corps during the early hours of the crisis, and Toby apologizes. Josh obeys a subpoena to give a deposition about a recent investigation; Sam represents him on the second day, which does not go well. Mandy ruffles feathers among the senior staffers with her plan to advise a moderate Republican congressman. Zoey invites Charlie to ask her for a date; he asks for permission from her father, who first balks but later agrees and cautions him.",

C.J. and Danny continue to deal with their relationship. An influential man offers Leo some unwelcome advice, which he refuses. A senior member of the House of Representatives summons Josh and Sam and leans hard on them; they make a deal, which avoids a hearing on Leo and the related inquiries. Sam finds out how Lillienfield and Claypool obtained the information about Leo's addiction and treatment. Leo and a young lady (Liza Weil) agree to give each other a second chance.",

        "expandedSummary": "Late on a Friday, the Supreme Court declines to set aside the death sentence of a federal prisoner for two drug-related murders and orders the execution to take place early on the following Monday. One of the appellant's public defenders is Sam's former bully from high school, who places a last-effort call to Sam in hopes of saving his client through presidential intervention. Sam answers as he unsuccessfully tries to leave the White House for a weekend of sailing, and the two then meet in person. On Saturday morning, President Bartlet returns from Stockholm; Donna finds Josh asleep and hungover in his office after a bachelor party. Sam calls Toby at his temple, while his rabbi presents a sermon against capital punishment, as Sam's classmate found the rabbi and arranged for him to preach to Toby. Meanwhile, Josephine “Joey” Lucas (Marlee Matlin), the deaf campaign manager for a Democratic House candidate from Southern California, using American Sign Language through her interpreter Kenny, aggressively asks Josh why the White House has caused the Democratic National Committee to reduce the funding for her campaign, and then demands to meet the President. When Josh assures her that there is no way for her to meet the President, he appears at Josh's door and gives Joey a tour of the Oval Office. The President calls the Pope and sends for the parish priest (Karl Malden, in his final acting role) whom he knew as a boy; he also discusses the death penalty separately with Charlie and with Joey, who is a Quaker. As Joey and Kenny leave their hotel to return to California, Josh, at the request of the President, offers Joey an apology and a suggestion. The President continues to agonize over his decision and makes a confession to the priest.",

Sam and Toby fly to Westchester County Airport to drive to Wesley, Connecticut, where Mendoza is being held.\n Josh, finishing his conversation with Sam, sits down with an interviewer at a lecture hall to speak about his time working in the White House in front of an audience. Asked to describe a typical day at the White House, he narrates a story from two days before, with flashbacks interspersed throughout. Josh begins his story with Sam, C.J., and Toby Ziegler preparing for a press conference to promote President Bartlet's new initiatives for public education. Sam and C.J. want to push the press conference to 1 pm, after a bill signing, but C.J. has a dentist appointment at noon. Sam moves the briefing anyway.\n Meanwhile, the secretary for Housing and Urban Development, an African American woman, called a prominent congressman racist while testifying before Congress. Secretary O'Leary told Congressman Wooden that he and his Republican colleagues more interested in 'scoring political points on the backs of poor people and minorities' than he was in solving the problems facing public housing. At the bill signing for the President's education initiative, the President was asked by Washington Post reporter Danny Concannon whether he thought Congressman Wooden was also a racist, and whether or not O'Leary should apologize for her remarks. The President initially sidestepped the question, but eventually remarked that \"O'Leary had gone too far in assigning motive\", and agreed that she should apologize. O'Leary was summoned to the White House to talk to Leo McGarry, where he tells her that she has to apologize. O'Leary objects, arguing that she was right and that apologizing would be contrary to her role as the highest-ranking African-American in the government. McGarry counters that the White House needs Republican support to pass legislation, and that her primary role is to serve the President. McGarry tells O'Leary that the President has to fire her if she doesn't apologize.\n Meanwhile, C.J. has cotton put in her mouth that renders her unable to speak clearly and brief the press, due to an emergency 'woot canal.' Instead of cancelling the briefing, Josh convinces C.J. to let him conduct the briefing. Danny Concannon, seeing Josh enter the press room, warns Josh not to conduct the briefing, but Josh brushes him off, telling him that the reporters have been 'coddled.' Josh makes several disastrous blunders during the briefing, including calling a reporter's question 'stupid,' inventing a 'secret plan to fight inflation' from the President when no such plan existed, and stating that the President had not smoked a cigarette in years, when he in fact had borrowed a cigarette from a reporter a few days prior, while on Air Force One. Josh is briefly excoriated and mocked for his performance in the press room by C.J., Toby, and Sam, before Sam informs the group that Mendoza had publicly rebuked the President for asking Secretary O'Leary to apologize. Mendoza was summoned from his vacation in Nova Scotia to come to the White House, but Mendoza informed them that he would be taking several days to arrive, driving down from Nova Scotia to Washington, D.C., stopping to go antiquing in Connecticut, where he was arrested.\n Sam and Toby, meanwhile, have gotten lost on their way to find Mendoza. Sam had been attempting to use celestial navigation, using the North Star as a fixed point, although the star in question turned out to be the Delta Shuttle from LaGuardia Airport. When they do find the police station, Sam and Toby speak to the officers, explaining that they are from the White House and that Mendoza needs to be released. The officers are skeptical, but a newspaper clipping with an image of Toby next to the President proves their story. While Toby is talking to Mendoza, the sergeant on duty tells Sam that Mendoza's driving was faulty, and that he wasn't sure that Mendoza hadn't been drinking alcohol. Sam responds by informing the officers that Mendoza has a chronic illness that would render any significant drinking fatal. During Toby's conversation with Mendoza, he expressed frustration at how he'd been treated by the police, telling Toby that he'd been searched and handcuffed by police in front of his wife and nine-year old son. Mendoza vowed to use the criminal justice system to acquit himself, instead of letting the White House get him out, but Toby countered that Mendoza could make a much bigger difference on the Supreme Court, and that he would be unable to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate if the story circulates. Toby also sympathized with Mendoza's desire to not face his wife and son after what had happened to him. Mendoza agrees to be released, and Toby tells the officers on duty that in exchange for Mendoza's release, and the officers' apologizing to Mendoza and to his son, the incident will remain off the record and no lawsuit will be filed against the county. Mendoza gets in the car with Sam and Toby, and Josh finishes his interview by beginning to take questions from the audience.",

The President expresses concern about a pending 50-50 vote on a Senate bill about a tax credit for the production of ethanol as a fuel, and meets Gina Toscano (Jorja Fox), the Secret Service agent assigned to Zoey. The agenda, filling the day and evening, includes a debate on a proposed amendment to the Constitution to prohibit burning the national flag, a town-hall meeting on school vouchers, and a celebrity-packed fundraising dinner at the home of Ted Marcus (Bob Balaban), the president of a film studio. Ted learns that a conservative congressman has introduced a bill in the House to ban gays from the armed forces and that the White House does not actively oppose the bill, so Marcus threatens to cancel the fundraising event. Josh arranges ten minutes for Marcus and the President alone, and the party proceeds. Joey Lucas attends and explains some interesting numbers to Josh, Sam, Toby, and C.J. Leo, back in Washington, asks the Vice President to break the tie in the Senate in favor of the bill, but the Vice President prefers not to do so because of personal, political, and ideological reasons; however, Sam and Leo arrange for three reluctant senators to vote \"nay\", thus letting the Vice President off the hook.",

Leo, to settle the uncertainty in the investment markets, urges the President to announce a successor, but the President decides takes time to make sure, although, according to a leak, the First Lady has expressed her preference, who also happens to be a former boyfriend. Josh and Toby court additional votes in the Congress to run up the score on the vote on a global trade agreement, and a congresswoman gives Sam a courtesy advance notice of a forthcoming announcement about her rider on the exploitation of child labor, which Sam expects to \"blow the vote out of the water\". Sam speaks with the First Lady, who negotiates for the withdrawal of the rider. The First Lady reveals who leaked her preference and the Bartlets have what they call their first Oval Office fight, but they quickly make up. The White House has received death threats and other hate mail from white supremacists about the relationship between Zoey and Charlie, who argue about their plans for Friday night; later, Charlie shows up at Zoey's dorm room with flowers, other gifts, and an apology.",

The next day, however, ushers in a myriad of problems that bring the senior staff quickly back to Earth. Zoey attends a frat party which was the location of a Metro Police drug bust and subsequent arrest of the son of a major fundraiser for the Democrats after her departure. A reporter for a conservative newspaper tries to cause problems while C.J. and others try to minimize it as a non-story, which becomes more of a struggle when C.J. discovers that Zoey did not tell her the whole truth. C.J.'s morning meetings are with Charlie, Danny, Zoe, Gina, Sam, and the President. Mallory, Leo's daughter, quarrels with Sam about school vouchers. Mandy asks Toby for help in getting a replacement panda from the Chinese government and gets him to help her to cause pain for Josh. Meanwhile, due to an objection by a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Josh has a long and vigorous discussion about reparations (of $1.7 trillion) for slavery with a candidate for an appointment to the post of the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.",

        "expandedSummary": "When the weather suddenly changes just before a speech by President Bartlet, Sam forgets to change the introductory remarks, thus creating a humorous and embarrassing moment. Two members of the Federal Election Commission have resigned, so the staff members start preparing for new appointments; Josh meets with the Senate leadership from both parties, but the conversation does not go well. Both the staff and the press hear a rumor about the circulation of an unknown memo; Mandy volunteers to C.J. that she wrote the memo when she worked for Sen. Russell, and that it outlines both the weaknesses of the Bartlet administration and a strategy to defeat President Bartlet for the nomination for reelection. C.J. demands a copy immediately and Mandy complies. After reading it, C.J. approaches Toby, who shares it with Josh, who comments that their second year has not gone better than their first. Sam and Toby meet with a group of military officers about a recommendation to the President on the service of gays in the armed forces, but that discussion too does not go well; Admiral Fitzwallace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, pops in and offers his advice; eventually the meeting ends without achieving anything. Mrs. Landingham encourages the President to improve his eating choices. C.J. learns which reporter has the damaging memo, and she hears that a story will appear in print the next morning. Margaret has computer and email problems, and Leo reads the memo. The President reads it, then he and Leo have a heart-to-heart chat, after which Leo tells the senior staffers that they will start raising the level of public debate in the nation and let that be their legacy even if they do lose some political battles; they agree that they serve at the pleasure of the President, and Leo tells them to get into the game.",

        "expandedSummary": "After last-minute quibbling over the wording of several questions, the senior staff start a nationwide telephone poll to measure the job-approval rating of the administration. The majority of the staff think the poll will show a decrease in the rating, but C.J. believes the numbers will go up; however, when the President asks Leo what the senior staff thinks the results will be, Leo omits C.J.'s prediction, which hurts her when she finds out and leads her to speak up for herself and her opinions. Leo gives a snow job to the lone reform-minded member of the Federal Election Commission. With regret, Sam explains to Laurie that he cannot attend her graduation from law school. He later goes against Leo's orders and presents her a gift outside her friend's apartment that night, but someone takes a photograph of the encounter, which was a set-up organized by Laurie's friend, and it reaches the attention of President Bartlet. The President accepts a round-robin plan to change several US ambassadors due to the personal misconduct of the present ambassador to Bulgaria. C.J. spars with the press corps about treatment, rehabilitation, and mandatory minimum sentences for convicted drug users. The President makes a deal seeking reform on soft-money political contributions. Eventually C.J. receives the results of the poll, goes to the Oval Office, and presents them to the President.",

        "expandedSummary": "Iraqi ground forces, using a surface-to-air missile, shoot down an F-117 Nighthawk of the US Air Force during a routine three-hour patrol of a no-fly zone; the pilot, a 26-year-old captain, survives, but Iraqis are only 10 miles away. President Bartlet orders a military rescue immediately. The staff learns that the Space Shuttle Columbia has incurred a mechanical problem and a resulting delay in its landing, and that Toby's brother is a payload specialist aboard the flight. Later, the officials learn that the rescue of the downed pilot has succeeded. The President, Zoey, and the senior staff go to a museum in Rosslyn, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, where the President speaks in a town-hall meeting, during which Josh signals him that the problem with the shuttle has been resolved. Afterward, as the group returns to the motorcade, Zoey's Secret Service agent Gina Toscano sees something, but is unable to piece it together before two unknown concealed gunmen begin shooting. The screen goes to black, leaving the fate of the President and senior staff unknown.",
        "expandedPlot": "\"What Kind of Day Has it Been\" begins with the president attending a town hall meeting at the Newseum in Rosslyn, Virginia. As the entourage exits the building, Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano seems to sense danger from the window of an overlooking building. The story is then told in retrospect starting with the day of President Bartlet preparing for the town hall question and answer session that evening. Meanwhile, the Secret Service are becoming increasingly concerned about threats on the life of the President's youngest daughter, Zoey, and her black boyfriend, the President's personal aide, Charlie, from White Supremacist groups. In addition to this, the military are performing a delicate rescue mission of an American pilot, stranded in Iraq, with Iraqi security forces trying to find him.\n\nToby is worried, because his brother is in a space shuttle orbiting Earth but unable to land due to some technical problems. Josh has to put some pressure on Vice President Hoynes, on the subject of campaign finance reform. C.J. has to lie to the press to keep the Iraqi rescue mission covert, but doing so she incurs the anger of reporter Danny Concannon.\n\nReturning to the town hall meeting, the evening is turning into a great success for the whole Bartlet administration. The pilot was saved without any bloodshed and while Bartlet is answering questions, the news comes through that the shuttle carrying Toby's brother is safe. As the senior staff come out of the building laughing and joking, Gina tells Zoey to get in the car, made nervous by the sight of a young man who doesn't seem to fit with the crowd. Suddenly, the man looks up to a window and removes his hat, before disappearing. As Gina turns around, she spots two more men aiming guns out of said window, and yells a warning, screaming \"GUN!\". Suddenly shots ring out. Scenes show each member of the senior staff being thrown to the ground by agents and chaos erupting. As the scene pans out to show the carnage, a Secret Service agent can be heard on the radio, asking \"Who's been hit?! Who's been hit?!\"",

            "briefSummary": "Part 1 of 2. The Bartlet administration is in chaos---an assassination attempt has left the White House (not to mention the country) reeling. Who was hit? Was anyone killed? Who did it? And why? The episode includes flashbacks detailing how the administration came to be. Oh, and one more thing: there's a downed fighter pilot in Iraq.",
            "expandedSummary": "During the aftermath of the shooting in Rosslyn, it becomes obvious that President Bartlet was shot in the back, Josh in the stomach, Charlie (the apparent target of the racist shooters, which a conspirator later confirms when he is arrested) remained unharmed, and the two shooters died at the scene. Gina reports an accomplice and a signal to the shooters from the ground. The motorcade heads first toward the White House and then to the George Washington University Hospital; Zoey, Leo, and Abbey join the President at the hospital. Josh, in critical condition, arrives in an ambulance, and Sam and Toby join the crowd. As Josh goes under general anesthesia, he starts to experience a series of flashbacks, first to the time when he ran the campaign for the nomination of Sen. Hoynes. He then listened to Leo's urging of him to go to Nashua, New Hampshire, to check out Gov. Bartlet, and then a completely-impressed Josh recruited Sam from a miserable, white-collar law job in NYC to join him and help elect \"the real thing.\" Meanwhile, a high-level meeting takes place in the Situation Room. Toby also has a flashback about Nashua, when then-Gov. Bartlet's cronies want him fired. Leo instead fires them all and keeps Toby, telling Jed that he is sick of terrible campaigns between terrible candidates and wants to show a good man can be elected President of the United States. A large group of state and federal police grab the accomplice. C.J., in flashback, recalls the time when Toby, on behalf of Leo, invited her to join the Bartlet presidential campaign after she was fired from a high-powered Hollywood PR job to appease an incompetent, arrogant studio executive; she has several problems with the press corps and with her own memory. During a flashback about the campaign in New Hampshire, Gov. Bartlet explains the meaning of \"What's next?\", and Donna, who had driven from Wisconsin, introduces herself to Josh as his new assistant, then admits that she \"may have overstated a little\", yet he puts her on the staff. Josh also reflects on how Jed won the Illinois primary the same night his father Noah died, and we see that's also when Jed became \"ready\" to run for President. Eventually, after more flashbacks, Josh awakes from anesthesia, and he weakly asks the President, \"What's next?\"",

            "expandedSummary": "During the aftermath of the shooting in Rosslyn, it becomes obvious that President Bartlet was shot in the back, Josh in the stomach, Charlie (the apparent target of the racist shooters, which a conspirator later confirms when he is arrested) remained unharmed, and the two shooters died at the scene. Gina reports an accomplice and a signal to the shooters from the ground. The motorcade heads first toward the White House and then to the George Washington University Hospital; Zoey, Leo, and Abbey join the President at the hospital. Josh, in critical condition, arrives in an ambulance, and Sam and Toby join the crowd. As Josh goes under general anesthesia, he starts to experience a series of flashbacks, first to the time when he ran the campaign for the nomination of Sen. Hoynes. He then listened to Leo's urging of him to go to Nashua, New Hampshire, to check out Gov. Bartlet, and then a completely-impressed Josh recruited Sam from a miserable, white-collar law job in NYC to join him and help elect \"the real thing.\" Meanwhile, a high-level meeting takes place in the Situation Room. Toby also has a flashback about Nashua, when then-Gov. Bartlet's cronies want him fired. Leo instead fires them all and keeps Toby, telling Jed that he is sick of terrible campaigns between terrible candidates and wants to show a good man can be elected President of the United States. A large group of state and federal police grab the accomplice. C.J., in flashback, recalls the time when Toby, on behalf of Leo, invited her to join the Bartlet presidential campaign after she was fired from a high-powered Hollywood PR job to appease an incompetent, arrogant studio executive; she has several problems with the press corps and with her own memory. During a flashback about the campaign in New Hampshire, Gov. Bartlet explains the meaning of \"What's next?\", and Donna, who had driven from Wisconsin, introduces herself to Josh as his new assistant, then admits that she \"may have overstated a little\", yet he puts her on the staff. Josh also reflects on how Jed won the Illinois primary the same night his father Noah died, and we see that's also when Jed became \"ready\" to run for President. Eventually, after more flashbacks, Josh awakes from anesthesia, and he weakly asks the President, \"What's next?\"",

Sam strongly encourages one of his law-school classmates, Tom, to run for a seat in the Congress. However, C.J. and Leo separately learn damaging facts about Tom and racism, so Leo directs Sam to cancel the support for Tom and Sam is left saddened and shaken. Later Josh returns to his apartment, where Donna visits him, often taking lunch and papers. The President takes an unusual interest in a school board election, which the senior staff is alarmed to learn is because a Republican who shared mutual loathing with (and narrowly lost a Congressional race to) Bartlet is running for an open spot, but the President eventually accepts his old foe will win that important, if overlooked, contest. Toby remains in a morose mood while he seeks to act against hate groups, and the President speaks with him. The President makes an appearance at a reception for radio talk show hosts, where he engages, questions, and completely blows apart the reactionary views of a radio counselor. Charlie has behaved toward Zoey in a cool and distant way since the attempt on his life, but warms up. C.J., Sam, Toby, and Donna chat with Josh on his front steps, and they share a patriotic toast.",

On a television political talk show a young woman Southern Republican lawyer, Ainsley Hayes (Emily Procter), soundly trounces Sam on the subject of competing bills under consideration in the House for funding of improvements in public education. The president of the African nation of Kundu, representing several African countries, visits the White House during a summit of officials of US pharmaceutical firms in an attempt to make certain drugs more accessible to HIV-blighted regions of Africa. At the direction of President Bartlet, Leo hires Ainsley as an associate counsel, and she takes the job after angrily telling her Republican friends that their disagreements with the Bartlet Administration are both personal and utter garbage. The Kundunese President learns there has been a coup in his country and his family is either dead or has fled the country; he is offered sanctuary in the United States but says he must return to help his people---where coup forces murder him at the airport upon his arrival in Kundu.",

Meanwhile, Sam hits upon the idea of Josh suing the hate group whose members shot him; and C.J. stares down a soon-to-retire general (Tom Bower) who's planning to blast the administration on TV talk shows.",
            "expandedSummary": "Josh runs into trouble with an insurance carrier over its refusal to pay $50,000 of his hospital bill; while Sam lends a hand, he suggest Josh sue the Ku Klux Klan, who were indirectly responsible for him getting shot. President Bartlet uses many takes to tape a radio address. Ainsley meets her new boss, Lionel Tribbey (John Larroquette), the White House Counsel, who puts on quite a show. The first lady says the President is well enough for sex, but he faces frustrating delays. C.J. has to deal with a decorated Army general who finds the administration's defense pathetic; she eventually finds out he wears medals he may not have earned and gets him to shut up, but the President later tells her to allow him to speak. Leo shows Ainsley to her basement office. Lionel welcomes her in his own way, and he assigns her first task, which takes her into conflict with two other staff lawyers; Sam deals with the conflict. Sam, Josh, C.J., and Toby help Ainsley with the decor in her office.",

Meanwhile, Donna goes on the warpath over carpel-tunnel syndrome; Sam and Ainsley teach each other a thing or two; and a Ukrainian reformer (Eugene Lavarev) shows up---drunk---at the White House, demanding to see the President.",
            "expandedSummary": "An announcement by a senator makes it appear that the administration will likely have no chance of a favorable vote on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the next session of the Senate, so Josh, Sam, and Toby urge President Bartlet to call a lame-duck session that will get the 12 Democratic senators who were voted out a chance to pass the treaty. C.J. intentionally leaks to Danny that the President has begun to consider that possibility. A Ukrainian politician, who is both pro-U.S. and a raging alcoholic, arrives at the White House and demands to speak with the President; Josh meets him and a companion and deals with them. Ainsley goes with Sam to Capitol Hill for meetings. Sam asks Ainsley to summarize a 22-page position paper; she does so and more. Toby meets with a lame-duck Senator from Pennsylvania who explains to a surprised Toby why he will not go against the wishes of his home state's voters. Leo arranges for the President to speak briefly with the foreign politician. The President decides not to call a special session.",
            "expandedPlot": "As the last days of the lame-duck Congress roll forward, Sam Seaborn outlines a long list of Senate committee reassignments that are going to take place under the incoming GOP-led body of law, finishing with the news that a Republican opponent of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is going to head up the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has made it clear he will not allow the Treaty to come up for voting. Sam's idea that they should try to call a lame-duck session of Congress to pass the Treaty before this happens gets the OK. Communications Director Toby Ziegler leads the effort but is stunned when he learns that recently defeated Senator Marino (D-PA) will not vote for the Treaty, because he was its primary sponsor during his Senate days. Senator Marino meets with Toby and explains that he will respect the views of the voters who sent him home largely because of his support of the Treaty, and the White House simply gives up on the Treaty for now.\nChief of Staff Leo McGarry and Press Secretary C.J. Cregg have to do some fancy diplomatic footwork when a very pro-Western but equally pro-alcohol Ukrainian politician shows up at the White House demanding to meet with the President. Leo's tip about how the Dalai Lama was able to 'accidentally' have a meeting with a former President sets up a quick discussion between the President and the Ukrainian, who leaves the White House happy to know that they look forward to working with him if/when he becomes his country's leader, and leaves the President and Leo happy that they have avoided a major international incident.\nSam responds to Leo's new guideline for shorter policy summaries by working with Ainsley Hayes on a plan to prevent small-business fraud, but she impresses Sam so much he adopts all of her ideas and sends the plan forward to Leo and the President.",

Back at the White House, Josh spars with a gay Republican congressman over a bill on homosexual marriage, and Leo monitors a minor crisis in the Persian Gulf involving an oil tanker.",

Meanwhile, back at the West Wing, Leo and others deal with an oil tanker suspected of hauling forbidden black-market Iraqi crude oil in violation of UN sanctions, and Josh talks with a gay Republican member of the House who supports a bill against same-sex marriage. Sam questions his writing ability when he cannot find or create an inspiring tone for the speech. Charlie proposes a concept, which gets the President's attention and Toby's recommendation.",

            "briefSummary": "It's the week before Thanksgiving and a shipload of illegal immigrants from China has just been intercepted. They're claiming asylum as persecuted Christians. Meanwhile, Toby presses the President to appoint Leo's sister (Deborah Hedwall), the superintendent of schools in Atlanta, to an important Education Department post. Making this politically dicey is that she's a foe of school prayer.",
            "expandedSummary": "Just before Thanksgiving Day a container ship arrives in San Diego, California, from the Far East; one container holds 83 surviving refugees from the People's Republic of China and the bodies of 13 who have died during the voyage; the survivors claim to be Christian evangelicals fleeing from persecution by the Communist government, and they request religious asylum. Toby and President Bartlet add the name of Josephine McGarry, Leo's sister, to a list of recess appointments, but Leo opposes the move. Leo points out a particular photograph in a newspaper, which helps him persuade her to withdraw. The President summons a representative of the Chinese illegal immigrants and speaks briefly with him in the Oval Office; the President then talks with the governor of California by telephone and makes arrangements to serve the needs of the immigrants and to allow the Chinese government to save face. Charlie spends a great deal of time finding a new carving knife for the President, who gives Charlie the one passed down through his family from Paul Revere. The President pardons one turkey and drafts another into military service.",

            "briefSummary": "It's the Christmas season at the White House but Josh isn't merry: he's rude to everyone, including the President---something that just isn't done. So Leo orders therapy. Meanwhile, C.J. takes interest when an elderly woman on a White House tour loses her composure at the sight of a painting. And the President decides that he wants to sign all his Christmas cards---well, maybe just 100,000 of them---personally. ",
            "expandedSummary": "Josh grows ever more anxious and volatile after his shooting, and is ordered by Leo to see a psychiatrist. C.J. uncovers a Nazi-looted painting at the White House and Sam voices support for tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma makes a guest appearance.",
            "expandedPlot": "Due to his colleagues' growing concern over his behavior Josh spends the day with Stanley Keyworth, a psychotherapist from the American Trauma Victims Association (ATVA). Stanley notices Josh's bandaged hand and asks about it. Josh insists that he cut his hand on a glass, even though Stanley makes it clear that he doesn't believe him. Josh recounts the last few weeks:\nHis behavior began to change on the day that he was assigned to review the personal and military history of an Air Force pilot who had broken away from his fighter jet's training formation. Josh had discovered that the two shared the same birthday, and that the pilot had been shot down and injured over Bosnia. Before Josh had a chance to report on this, the pilot radioed in to say, \"It wasn't the plane,\" and killed himself by crashing into a mountain in New Mexico. Days later, while discussing a political situation, Josh raised his voice to the President in the Oval Office, at which point Leo called in ATVA to talk to him. During the congressional Christmas party, Yo-Yo Ma performed Bach's Suite No. 1 in G major and Josh was overcome with panic. When he went home, he slammed his hand into his window and cut himself on the broken glass.\nStanley asks Josh if, given what he had in common with the pilot---their common birthday and injuries---he wondered if he himself might have been suicidal. Josh initially denies this, but eventually admits that during the party he found himself reliving the attack at Rosslyn and that he felt out of control. Stanley tells him that his increasing stress and the episode at the party were triggered by the presence of a brass quintet at the White House, which subconsciously reminded Josh of police and ambulance sirens, thereby transporting him back to his own shooting and near-death in Rosslyn. He is diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and is concerned that it will endanger his job (\"That doesn't sound like something they let you have if you work for the President\") but Leo promises him \"as long as I got a job, you got a job\" in a moving speech which aligns Josh's trauma with Leo's own difficult past.\nIn another story, C.J. is told by a reporter that a woman saw a painting on the White House Tour and began screaming. C.J. does some research and finds out with the help of Bernard Thatch, the White House's snobbish but competent Protocol Chief, that the painting was owned by a Jewish family in Europe, seized by the Nazi collaborationist French Vichy Regime, and eventually given as a gift to the White House by the French government. The woman's father owned the painting, and C.J. returns it to the grateful woman and her son.\nSam is interested in a measure to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce high gas prices, and the staff decides to review the issue when the new year begins. Finally, the President wants to sign all of his holiday cards by hand, until he is told the total number of cards is 1,110,000.",
