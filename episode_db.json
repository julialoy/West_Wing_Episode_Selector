            "briefSummary": "Part 1 of two. The Bartlet administration is in chaos---an assassination attempt has left the White House (not to mention the country) reeling. Who was hit? Was anyone killed? Who did it? And why? The episode includes flashbacks detailing how the administration came to be. Oh, and one more thing: there's a downed fighter pilot in Iraq.",
            "expandedSummary": "During the aftermath of the shooting in Rosslyn, it becomes obvious that President Bartlet was shot in the back, Josh in the stomach, Charlie (the apparent target of the racist shooters, which a conspirator later confirms when he is arrested) remained unharmed, and the two shooters died at the scene. Gina reports an accomplice and a signal to the shooters from the ground. The motorcade heads first toward the White House and then to the George Washington University Hospital; Zoey, Leo, and Abbey join the President at the hospital. Josh, in critical condition, arrives in an ambulance, and Sam and Toby join the crowd. As Josh goes under general anesthesia, he starts to experience a series of flashbacks, first to the time when he ran the campaign for the nomination of Sen. Hoynes. He then listened to Leo's urging of him to go to Nashua, New Hampshire, to check out Gov. Bartlet, and then a completely-impressed Josh recruited Sam from a miserable, white-collar law job in NYC to join him and help elect \"the real thing.\" Meanwhile, a high-level meeting takes place in the Situation Room. Toby also has a flashback about Nashua, when then-Gov. Bartlet's cronies want him fired. Leo instead fires them all and keeps Toby, telling Jed that he is sick of terrible campaigns between terrible candidates and wants to show a good man can be elected President of the United States. A large group of state and federal police grab the accomplice. C.J., in flashback, recalls the time when Toby, on behalf of Leo, invited her to join the Bartlet presidential campaign after she was fired from a high-powered Hollywood PR job to appease an incompetent, arrogant studio executive; she has several problems with the press corps and with her own memory. During a flashback about the campaign in New Hampshire, Gov. Bartlet explains the meaning of \"What's next?\", and Donna, who had driven from Wisconsin, introduces herself to Josh as his new assistant, then admits that she \"may have overstated a little\", yet he puts her on the staff. Josh also reflects on how Jed won the Illinois primary the same night his father Noah died, and we see that's also when Jed became \"ready\" to run for President. Eventually, after more flashbacks, Josh awakes from anesthesia, and he weakly asks the President, \"What's next?\"",

            "expandedSummary": "During the aftermath of the shooting in Rosslyn, it becomes obvious that President Bartlet was shot in the back, Josh in the stomach, Charlie (the apparent target of the racist shooters, which a conspirator later confirms when he is arrested) remained unharmed, and the two shooters died at the scene. Gina reports an accomplice and a signal to the shooters from the ground. The motorcade heads first toward the White House and then to the George Washington University Hospital; Zoey, Leo, and Abbey join the President at the hospital. Josh, in critical condition, arrives in an ambulance, and Sam and Toby join the crowd. As Josh goes under general anesthesia, he starts to experience a series of flashbacks, first to the time when he ran the campaign for the nomination of Sen. Hoynes. He then listened to Leo's urging of him to go to Nashua, New Hampshire, to check out Gov. Bartlet, and then a completely-impressed Josh recruited Sam from a miserable, white-collar law job in NYC to join him and help elect \"the real thing.\" Meanwhile, a high-level meeting takes place in the Situation Room. Toby also has a flashback about Nashua, when then-Gov. Bartlet's cronies want him fired. Leo instead fires them all and keeps Toby, telling Jed that he is sick of terrible campaigns between terrible candidates and wants to show a good man can be elected President of the United States. A large group of state and federal police grab the accomplice. C.J., in flashback, recalls the time when Toby, on behalf of Leo, invited her to join the Bartlet presidential campaign after she was fired from a high-powered Hollywood PR job to appease an incompetent, arrogant studio executive; she has several problems with the press corps and with her own memory. During a flashback about the campaign in New Hampshire, Gov. Bartlet explains the meaning of \"What's next?\", and Donna, who had driven from Wisconsin, introduces herself to Josh as his new assistant, then admits that she \"may have overstated a little\", yet he puts her on the staff. Josh also reflects on how Jed won the Illinois primary the same night his father Noah died, and we see that's also when Jed became \"ready\" to run for President. Eventually, after more flashbacks, Josh awakes from anesthesia, and he weakly asks the President, \"What's next?\"",

Sam strongly encourages one of his law-school classmates, Tom, to run for a seat in the Congress. However, C.J. and Leo separately learn damaging facts about Tom and racism, so Leo directs Sam to cancel the support for Tom and Sam is left saddened and shaken. Later Josh returns to his apartment, where Donna visits him, often taking lunch and papers. The President takes an unusual interest in a school board election, which the senior staff is alarmed to learn is because a Republican who shared mutual loathing with (and narrowly lost a Congressional race to) Bartlet is running for an open spot, but the President eventually accepts his old foe will win that important, if overlooked, contest. Toby remains in a morose mood while he seeks to act against hate groups, and the President speaks with him. The President makes an appearance at a reception for radio talk show hosts, where he engages, questions, and completely blows apart the reactionary views of a radio counselor. Charlie has behaved toward Zoey in a cool and distant way since the attempt on his life, but warms up. C.J., Sam, Toby, and Donna chat with Josh on his front steps, and they share a patriotic toast.",
